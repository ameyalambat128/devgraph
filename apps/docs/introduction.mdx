# What is DevGraph?

DevGraph is a universal context layer for codebases. It scans Markdown files for service definitions, builds a project graph, and generates outputs like `graph.json`, `summary.md`, and agent-specific context files.

One command to map your entire architecture—for humans and AI alike.
